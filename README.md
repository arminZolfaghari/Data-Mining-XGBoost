# Data-Mining-XGBoost
Data Mining Course Project: This project is the implementation of classifier for diabetes. We using the `XGBoost` library to train the XGBoost model to classify diabetes.</br>

## Diabetes Dataset
The [diabetes](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari/Data-Mining-XGBoost/blob/main/diabetes.csv) dataset includes more than 70000 that has been collected from patients. </br>
Dataset has 22 columns: </br>
`Diabetes_binary`, `HighBP`, `High Cholesterol`, `Cholesterol Check`, `BMI`, `Smoker`,
`Stroke`, `HeartDiseaseorAttack`, `Physical Activity`, `Fruits`, `Veggies`, `Heavy Alcohol Consumption`,
`Any Health Care`, `No Doctor because of Cost`, `General Health`, `Mental Health`, `Physical Health`, `Difficulty Walking`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Education`, `Income`.
</br>

## XGBoost
XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient-boosting framework.
In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks.
However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured/tabular data, decision tree-based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now.

[Project](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari/Data-Mining-XGBoost/blob/main/DM_XGBoost.ipynb) has 6 steps:
1. Import libraries
2. Getting the data
3. Preprocessing
4. Build XGBoost classifier model
5. Set hyperparameters (use GridSearchCV)
6. Visualization
